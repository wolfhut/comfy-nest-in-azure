## This is a collection of mostly runbooks. And some code.

I used to have a machine in my garage. It did my email, it was a web
server, a DNS server, it held all my files, it was where I could ssh
to from wherever I happened to be at the moment.

I no longer have a machine in my garage. I moved a bunch of stuff into
Azure, and thus began the journey...

So this is where I'm going to keep my runbooks, code, scripts, thoughts,
musings, etc. It's mostly for my own benefit, but I also want to offer
this stuff up too in case the stuff I've learned and accumulated since I
started doing this, might be useful to someone.

If you're perusing, it might be best to start in the
[rationale-and-motivations](rationale-and-motivations/) directory and
move outwards from there.
