# Office 365: Licenses and costs

You pay for licenses that are per-user. The three most interesting license
tiers seem to me to be: (listed in ascending order by price)
* [F1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/f1)
* [Business
  Basic](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business/microsoft-365-business-basic)
* [E1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/office-365-e1)

F1 comes with 2 GB of email storage, whereas Business Basic and E1 both
come with 50 GB.

Since you probably will need at least two accounts for yourself, one to
actually use day-to-day and one to use as an administrator account, one
natural way to split it up is to give the administrator account an F1
license, and give yourself one of the other two.

I'm not sure exactly why the difference in cost between Business Basic and
E1. They seem more or less identical to me. I currently have E1 for myself
but I might have to look into switching!

I have found it useful to have a "daemon" account with an F1 license
that doesn't get used for anything except sending out automated emails.
It's $4/month whereas the cheapest Sendgrid subscription is $10/month,
so it's a win there. And anything that has a need to send emails, can
share the credentials.
